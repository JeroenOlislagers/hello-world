# hello-world
This repository is used by me to learn about how GitHub works, I am following the Github tutorial to create it.

I want to learn about the general way Github is used, but with a specific goal in mind. My intention is to write a chess analysis program, using the Swift coding language. In order to aid development I'd like to use the several open source libraries in other languages, and integrate them into my project.
